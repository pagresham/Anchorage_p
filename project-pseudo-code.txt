This is some Pseudo-code!

I want to make a marshmellow/smore calculator for my camp's website.
A user would enter in variables:
	# of adults
	# of childeren 
	# of nights at camp
	which side of the lake youre on 
		camp side
			standard formula
		far side
			standard + xtra for George
				Reces large pb cups 1/night

App would return the number of: 
	chocolate bars
	Boxes of grahm crackers
	bags of marshmellows
	Reces for George

App would have a nice aesthetic. 
	Apear as a cool phone app.
	Use form elements to take in the data. 
		use Javascript to do the math.
