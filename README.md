# Anchorage_p
# This was the page I built for a class project in Summer of '16
# It provides info on my Lake camp in the Adirondaks.
# While the camp is for real, I am not really renting it out. 

# This page's contents is much the same as the Anchorage repo on Git Hub, but this project converts all files to php, and consolidates all headers and footers, and a couple other bits of repeated code.
